Create your Faq, Documentation or Blog with Notice.studio and improve your SEO. 

== Description ==

Notice allows you to create a faq, documentation or blog. It has an easy to use shortcode which renders Notice anywhere on your website. It makes your content visible to search engines, *converting 60% more users on Google.

Notice includes a contact form, articles rating, analytics and a search bar. Itâ€™s also a collaborative tool, allowing you to invite your team to edit your project together. Write once, display everywhere.

*By displaying Rich Snippets thanks to structured data, Notice makes your content stand out and rank higher than classic content on search engines.

Notice FAQ uses notice.studio 3rd party services such as [stylesheet](https://bundle.notice.studio/index.css) and [javascript](https://bundle.notice.studio/index.js) to render the project on your website based on [terms of use](https://notice.studio/terms-of-use/).
